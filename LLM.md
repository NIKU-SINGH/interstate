# LLM Changes Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to the codebase by the LLM.

## `src/utils/api.ts`
- Added new API client functions for limit order management:
  - `createLimitOrder`: Creates a new limit order.
  - `getMyLimitOrders`: Retrieves all limit orders for the authenticated user.
  - `updateLimitOrder`: Updates the status of an existing limit order.
- Defined interfaces for `CreateLimitOrderParams`, `LimitOrder`, and `UpdateLimitOrderParams` to ensure type safety for the new API calls.

## `src/utils/functions.ts`
- Added new utility functions for fetching trade-related data:
  - `getPrice`: Fetches the current price of a given token address.
  - `getPumpSwapPool`: Returns Pump.fun pool data for a token.
  - `getTradeHistoryByUser`: Fetches all trade history for a specific user.
  - `getTradeActivityByUser`: Returns all trades (buy/sell) executed by the user.
- Modified `getActivePositionsByUser` to ensure proper error handling and return an empty array on failure.

## `src/components/trade/TradeActionPanel.tsx`
- Integrated limit order creation functionality:
  - Imported `createLimitOrder` from `~/utils/api` and `useUser` from `~/components/UserContext`.
  - Added state variables for `targetMC`, `direction`, `isLoading`, and `message` to manage limit order form data and UI feedback.
  - Implemented conditional rendering for `targetMC` and `direction` input fields when the "Limit" tab is selected.
  - Updated the action button's `onClick` handler to call `createLimitOrder` when the "Limit" tab is active, including loading and error handling.
  - Added display for success or error messages after a limit order is placed.

## `src/components/trade/TradeTable.tsx`
- Created a new reusable component `TradeTable` to display trade data.
- Encapsulated the table structure, headers, and row rendering logic, including helper functions like `getAge`, `isBuy`, `getAmount`, `getTotalUSD`, `getMarketCap`, and `getTrader`.
- Added `shortAddr` helper function for displaying truncated addresses.

## `src/components/trade/Trades.tsx`
- Refactored to utilize the new `TradeTable` component for displaying trades.
- Modified the data fetching logic to conditionally use `getTradeActivityByUser` (if a user is logged in) or `getTradeHistoryByTokenAddress` (otherwise).
- Removed redundant local helper functions (e.g., `getAge`, `isBuy`, `getAmount`, `getTotalUSD`, `getMarketCap`, `getTrader`, `shortAddr`) as they are now part of `TradeTable.tsx`.

## `src/pages/portfolio.tsx`
- Integrated `TradeTable` for displaying trade history and activity.
- Added state variables (`tradeHistory`, `loadingTradeHistory`, `tradeActivity`, `loadingTradeActivity`) to manage data for the new trade history and activity sections.
- Implemented `useEffect` hooks to fetch trade history (`getTradeHistoryByUser`) and trade activity (`getTradeActivityByUser`) based on user login status and active tabs.
- Updated the rendering logic for the "History" and "Activity" tabs to display the `TradeTable` with fetched data, including loading and login prompts.

## `src/pages/trade/[id].tsx`
- Removed the local `tradeHistory` state and its related `setTradeHistory` calls in `handleBuy` and `handleSellPercentage` functions, as trade history is now managed and displayed by the `Trades` component which fetches its own data.
